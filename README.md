## Space Game

This project aims to design a space-themed arcade game using an Arduino microcontroller. Players control a spaceship to avoid and destroy meteors while scoring points. 
The game features random meteor falls, player movement using a potentiometer, and a scoring system with LEDs. The game is displayed on a small OLED screen and controlled by an Arduino Uno.

## Features

- Space-Themed Gameplay: Players control a spaceship to avoid and destroy meteors. The OLED screen shows the spaceship's position and meteor activity.
- Controls: The spaceship is controlled with a potentiometer, allowing left and right movement. A button is used to fire at meteors.
- Scoring & Difficulty: Players earn points by destroying meteors and surviving longer. The gameâ€™s difficulty increases as more meteors appear. Scores are displayed on a 7-segment LED.
- Game Over & Restart: If the player collides with a meteor, they lose a life. When all lives are lost, the game ends, and the score is shown. The game can be restarted.
